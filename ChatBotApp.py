# ChatBotApp.py
# Starter code for Python Chat Bot Program
# CIT-95 (Mohle) Spring 2024
# last updated: 4/24/24 by dH
# Suggested things to do:
#   Add chat memory
#   Use a local server like streamlit
#   Modify streamlit with HTML to make a nice looking chat bot
#   Use langchain framework to read .pdf files
#   Use an open source LLM that doesn't cost tokens


# pip install this dependency if you don't have this already
# pip install openai
import openai

# User-defined function go here, before the main() function (is a Python coding convention)

# Use this common Python idiom to check if your Python code is being run directly or being imported
# as a module into another program. This tells your program to start in a function named "main()"
# main() is not a reserved word in Python, but it is a standard convention and I suggest you use it
# to not confuse your project coworkers.
